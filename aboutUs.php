				<p><strong><span style="color: #006633; font-size: large;">Our Mission</span></strong></p>
				<p dir="LTR">The mission of our Academy is to create a challenging sport academic environment, while incorporating a modern athletic program that can be enjoyed by all.<br />
				Ace Sports Academy started out as a tennis academy, but has since progressed to offer a diverse range of sports such as badminton, football, cricket, Squash, swimming,Table Tennis, karate.</p>
				<p><strong>TENNIS</strong> is a sport that can be enjoyed by adults and children of all ages and levels and Ace Sports Academy strives to obtain maximum results for everyone, while still focusing on the fun element of tennis. Respect for yourself, the court and you opponent is widely encouraged.</p>
				<p><strong>CRICKET</strong> Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each turn is known as an innings.</p>
				<p><strong>FOOTBALL</strong> is a game in which two opposing teams of 11 players each defends the goal post at opposite ends of the field. It is a game filled with excitement and invigoration, enjoyed by fans all over the world.</p>
				<p><strong>SQUASH</strong> Squash is a racquet sport played by two (singles) or four players (doubles) in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racquet and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court.</p>
				<p><strong>TABLE TENNIS</strong> Table tennis is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth using a table tennis bat. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, players must allow a ball played toward them only one bounce on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. When doing so the hitter has a good chance of scoring if the spin is successful.</p>
				<p><strong>SWIMMING</strong> is a test of your own personal strength, to see how far you can push your body. Swimming is a race, against the clock, against yourself, and against your team-mates. Swimming is a sport that requires a passion and dedication in order to master and perfect swimming strokes.</p>
				<p><strong>KARATE</strong> is a method developed in Japan of defending oneself without the use of weapons, but by striking areas of a potential attacker with hands, elbows, knees or feet. Proven expert teaching methods help develop honour, respect, discipline, humility, courage, self-control and self-defense.</p>
				<p><strong>BADMINTON</strong> the objective of the game is simple, that is to hit the shuttle over the net so that it lands in your opponent&#8217;s court before it can be returned. You can hit the shuttle fast, slow, high, flat or low. You can smash it with maximum power or use the most delicate touch shots. Like tennis, Badminton can be played in singles or doubles.</p>
				<p><strong><span style="color: #006633; font-size: large;"><br />
