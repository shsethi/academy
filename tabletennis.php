          RULES OF TABLE TENNIS AND SCORING

        <p>Table tennis, also referred to as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using a small, round bat. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, players must allow a ball played toward them only one bounce on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. When doing so the hitter has a better chance of scoring if the spin is successful.</p></br>
        <b>New Badminton Scoring System</b></br>
        <p> The scoring system for badminton has changed in recent years. This was done to speed games up and make them more entertaining to watch. A badminton game is now played up to 21 points, and a point can be scored from every rally, irregardless of who is serving. Under the old system a point could only be scored by the player holding the serve. If the score reaches 20-20 then a two-point advantage is required for victory, however. If no player has managed to achieve this two-point advantage by the time the score reaches 29-29, then the first player to reach 30 is the winner. Matches are generally played over the best-of-three sets.</p>
		<b> Scoring </b></br>
		<p> A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally: </br>

      The opponent fails to make a correct service or return.</br>
      After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by the opponent.</br>
      The ball passes over the player's court or beyond his end line without touching his court, after being struck by the opponent.</br>
      The opponent obstructs the ball.</br>
      The opponent strikes the ball twice successively. Note that the hand that is holding the racket counts as part of the racket and that making a good return off one's hand or fingers is allowed. It is not a fault if the ball accidentally hits one's hand or fingers and then subsequently hits the racket.</br>
      The opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade whose surface is not covered with rubber.</br>
      The opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net assembly.</br>
      The opponent's free hand touches the playing surface.</br>
      As a receiver under the expedite system, completing 13 returns in a rally.</br>
      The opponent that has been warned by the umpire commits a second offense in the same individual match or team match. If the third offence happens, 2 points will be given to the player.[38] If the individual match or the team match has not ended, any unused penalty points can be transferred to the next game of that match.</br>
      A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games.[39] In competition play, matches are typically best of five or seven games</p></br>

        <p>The international rules specify that the game is played with a sphere having a mass of 2.7 grams (0.095 oz) and a diameter of 40 millimetres (1.57 in).</br> 
          The rules say that the ball shall bounce up 24–26 cm (9.4–10.2 in) when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm (12.0 in) onto a standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92. </br>
          The 40 mm ball was introduced after the 2000 Summer Olympics.[18] However, this created some controversy as the Chinese National Team argued that this was merely to give non-Chinese players a better chance of winning since the new type of ball has a slower speed,</br> 
          while at that time most Chinese players were playing with fast attack and smashes. (China won all four Olympic gold medals and three silvers in 2000, and have continued to dominate.) A 40 mm table tennis ball is slower and spins less than the original 38 mm one. </br>
          The ball is made of a high-bouncing air-filled celluloid or similar plastics material, coloured white or orange, with a matte finish. The choice of ball colour is made according to the table colour and its surroundings. For example, a white ball is easier to see on a green or blue table than it is on a grey table</p></br>

        	The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in)</br> 
          when a standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 77%. The table or playing surface is uniformly dark coloured and matte, divided into two halves by a net at 15.25 cm (6.0 in) in height.</br> 
          The ITTF approves only wooden tables or their derivates. Concrete tables with a steel net or a solid concrete partition are sometimes available in outside public spaces, such as parks.</p></br>

        <b>The Most Common Injury is…</b> </br>
        <b>Muscle strains.</b> </br><p> I strained my tricep on Saturday and it was the first time I’d ever really injured myself playing. Muscle strains are usually caused by the lack of a proper warm-up.</br>
         We all know that it’s important to get our muscles warm before playing but perhaps we don’t realise just how quickly they get cold again. I always do quite a comprehensive warm-up when I arrive at training or a tournament and I did so on Saturday.</br>
         The problem comes when you warm-up, play a match, and then sit down for 90 minutes until your next match.</br>

On Saturday, the hall was quite cold. I had been inactive for quite a long period of time watching and coaching my team mates. I then got up, took my tracksuit off and jumped on the table, without any thought for doing another warm-up.</br> 
This was the problem. I often see the top juniors get up five minutes before they are due to go on and go into the corridor to start warming up, ‘shadowing shots’ and the like. Perhaps this is something I’m going to need to incorporate into my routine.</br>

If we are properly warmed-up we should be fine reaching for those wide balls and quickly twisting and turning our body to finish off points. If we’re not warmed-up, and especially if the hall is cold, we’re kind of just waiting for a strain to happen.</p></br>
