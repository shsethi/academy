        <p>The standardisation of the rules of tennis is the responsibility of the ITF. Broadly speaking it is a very simple game to get to grips with. Here is a very basic beginners guide to the rules to help you get started:</p></br>
        <b>The Basics </b></br>
        <p>  Tennis is played either 1v1 (singles) or 2v2 (doubles). The teams will be on opposite sides of the net, and will use rackets to hit a ball back and forth across the net. Each team has one bounce to return the ball back over the net and into the opponents court. Failure to do so means the opponent scores a point. Points can be turned into games, and games into sets, with matches being decided by whichever team has won the required number of sets.
			Men's matches can be played up to a maximum of best-of-5 sets, and women's to a maximum of best-of-3.</p>
		<b> Scoring</b></br>
		<p> Tennis is renowned for its slightly odd scoring system. Points don't go up in the usual way, 1, 2, 3 etc. Instead points go up as 15, 30, 40 in tennis. For example, if both players have scored 2 points in a game, then the score would be 30-30.
			The first player to score 4 points wins that particular game. The only exception to this rule being when both players/teams have won 3 points each (40-40). This score is known as 'deuce', and it becomes the first to win 2 points in a row that wins the game.
			Usually the first team/player to win 6 games wins that set. However a margin of 2 games is required for victory. If the score reaches 5 games all then a set can be won 7-5. Traditionally a 2 game margin was always required and thus sets could last infinitely. However in more recent times a 'tie-break' has been adopted to decide close sets once they reach 6 games all. This move was made to limit match lengths and make matches more exciting.</p>      
			These 'tie-breaks' are played as the first to win 7 points - although once again a 2 point margin is required for victory. The winner of the 'tie-break' is the winner of the set.
			The majority of the Grand Slam's do not use 'tie-breaks' to decide a 5th set however, and still require a 2 game margin for victory. This means matches can last for a very lengthy time. This was demonstrated at Wimbledon 2010 when John Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut by 70 games to 68 in the 5th set of their first round encounter. The match lasted for over 11 hours - a record which is unlikely to be eclipsed.</br>
      	<b>Serving</b></br>
      	<p>Players must serve cross-court from behind their baseline, into the service box of their opponent. Players have 2 chances to successfully do this, or they lose the point.</p>

        <p>A tennis racket is a pivotal piece of kit for all players. Whether you own one or borrow one, it is impossible to play a game without it! Trying to find the right racket can be a very confusing and daunting experience for even the most experienced of players. Here, we will try and give you a bit of information to make this experience as hassle free as possible! </p></br>
        <b>Choosing a Tennis Racket</b> </br>
        <p>The age old question of 'which racket is best for me?' has been asked by many a tennis player around the globe. Choosing one can be an important decision for any aspiring player looking to perfect their game. Rackets come in all different shapes and colours, and at vastly differing prices, and it is impossible to give a generic answer as to which is the best. A racket which suits one person may not suit another, and vice-versa, as we are all unique with particular playing styles and preferences.
            There are a number of differences between tennis rackets. Slight variance in weight, balance, flexibility, grip size and string tension can all make a difference to the way a racket affects your game. </p></br>
        <b>And so...</b> </br>
        <p>The question - 'which racket is best for me?' - really is very subjective. Most lower end rackets are fairly all-covering, and will offer more forgiveness to the tennis beginner. With the more high-end products it really is a case of trial and error- but with vast rewards if you find the optimum racket which suits your game. There is a racket out there for everybody - its just a case of finding it! </p></br>

        	Questions are often asked about tennis balls - "what is the difference between one type of tennis ball and another?" "Why are they kept in pressurised cans?" Here we will try and answer these questions with our brief basic guide to tennis balls!
        </p></br>
        <b>History</b> </br>
        <p>Tennis balls of the past were made of a variety of different materials. Many types of animal furs and innards, tied up with string have been used in years gone by. King Louis XI of France also insisted tennis balls in France should be made of leather, stuffed with wool. As a result of all these variations over the years, tennis evolved at different rates around the world. Vulcanised rubber was first used for tennis balls in 1870 with the introduction of lawn tennis. Tennis balls were first sold in cylindrical tubes in 1925, when the Wilson-Western Sports Company came up with the idea.
            Nowadays, upwards of 300 millions balls are produced each year!</p></br>
            <b>Standard Modern Balls</b> </br>
        <p>These days balls must meet certain standard requirements. Obviously for fair international competitions, everyone must use similar balls around the world. The standardisation of balls is controlled by the ITF.
            Standard modern balls should have a diameter of between 2.575 inches and 2.7 inches. They should also weigh no less than 56 grams, and no more than 59.4 grams. The only colours approved for competitive play are yellow and white. Since 1972 the standard ball has been 'flourescent yellow', after a study showed that this was better for television coverage.
              Tennis balls are filled with air, which is then surfaced by a uniform felt-covered rubber compound. They are generally then kept in a pressurised container until they are required for play. As soon as a tin of balls is open and they are removed from these pressurised conditions a ball will begin to lose its bounce. At the top level balls are generally kept in these conditions until the last possible point. The loss in bounce is also why the balls are changed so regularly at elite level.
          </p></br>
          <b>Other Types Of Balls</b> </br>
        <p>In some situations you may be better to use different sorts of balls. The obvious example of this is with beginners or very young players. Other balls are made which may be slower and easier for inexperienced performers to learn with. This is one of the key features of the ITF's Play & Stay campaign. This follows a red, orange and green progression - with red balls being the slowest and easiest for beginners. As players learn skills they can progress along the pathway towards using the standard balls.</p></br>

        <p>The length of an entire tennis court is 78 ft. Luckily it is separated by a net through the middle, so you only have to cover your half! The width of a singles court is 27 ft and a doubles court is 36 ft. 21ft either side of the net are the service boxes.
            The net should be 3 ft high at the centre.</p></br>
        <b>What is in and out?</b> </br>
        <p>The rules of tennis are pretty simple. Basically in doubles a shot must bounce anywhere inside of the outer court boundaries to be considered as 'good'. The only difference in singles play is that the tramlines down the side of the court are deemed 'out'.
            The only exception to this is on the serve - which must be cross-court and into the opponents service box.</p></br>

        <p>Tennis, being a completely non-contact sport, has a lower incidence of injury, or at least acute, traumatic injury, that sports such as football. The majority of tennis injuries are more chronic overuse injuries such as tendonitis.</p></br>
        <b>Prevention</b> </br>
        <p>A large number of injuries, in all sports, especially at the lower levels, could be avoided. The following should not be neglected:</p></br>
        <b>Warm-up</b> </br>
        <p>The warm-up is one of the most important factors in all sports, in order to stay injury free. Tennis is a whole body sport and for that reason, the whole body should be warm-up and stretched, prior to hitting that first ball! Cardiovascular exercise should be the first component of a warm-up routine, in order to increase the circulation and warm the muscles. This should be followed by active stretches such as dynamic lunges and shoulder and wrist circles. Static stretches can also be performed.</p></br>
        <b>Equipment</b> </br>
    <p>
    The racket is the most obvious piece of equipment that a tennis player must ensure is right for them, to help avoid injuries. The most important factor is grip size. A grip size that is too small often places additional strain on the wrist, whereas a grip which is too large requires extra contraction of the forearm muscles and can contribute towards developing tennis elbow. A light racket and looser strings are less likely to cause injury.
    The availability and range of specific tennis footwear has improved in recent years. Shoes now have thicker rubber soles, reinforced mid-foot support and a wider toe area, all features designed to enable optimum performance and limit injury.    </p></br>
    <b>Technique</b><br>
    In order to avoid injury, the correct technique should be taught from the start. Learning the right techniques will help to reduce overuse injuries, such as tennis elbow, which is sometimes caused by a poor backhand stroke.
        <b>Strength</b> </br>
    <p>    
    Strength is important with any sport, but must be specific to the sport in question. Tennis is a fast paced sport requiring changes of direction and sudden bursts of speed. This requires a strong core to maintain the bodies centre of balance - important in avoiding injuries. Strength of the shoulder girdle, including the rotator cuff muscles, is also important in injury prevention.</p></br>

        <p>Injuries of the shoulder, elbow and wrist are amongst the most common injuries seen in tennis players. However, due to the bursts of speed and change of direction nature of the game, ankle and knee injuries are also common. </p></br>
        <b>Tennis elbow</b> </br>
        <p>This is the injury that everybody associates with tennis. However it is more commonly seen in people who have never played tennis, than those that do regularly. It is an overuse injury of the wrist extensor muscles, where they attach to the lateral epicondyle (bony part on the outside of the elbow). Symptoms include pain on wrist extension (bending the wrist back) and gripping the racket. Causes include poor technique and wrong grip size. </p></br>
        <b>Carpal tunnel syndrome </b> </br>
        <p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve is compressed within the wrist. In tennis, if there is no previous injury to the wrist, the cause is likely overuse and inflammatory causing swelling within the wrist and narrowing the carpal tunnel. Sometimes the cause can be structural due to a naturally smaller carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel causes pain in the wrist and handed, often accompanied by tingling in the fingers.</p></br>
        <b>Shoulder impingement</b> </br>
    <p>
    This refers to trapping and pinching of one or more of the rotator cuff tendons. This occurs due to narrowing of the space through which these tendons pass. The most common cause of this reduced space is biomechanical abnormality, usually associated with poor posture. Symptoms in shoulder impingement include pain with overhead movements - especially serving. Treatment usually consists of rest and ice, followed by a rehabilitation program. </br>
    </p>
    <b>Back injuries </b><br>
      <p>Back injuries are reported to make up to 16% of all tennis injuries. The most stress is placed on the spine during the serve, in both the extension phase when tossing the ball and in the action of the serve itself. Both movements involve a rotation force in conjunction with the main motion of flexion or extension. Facet joint injuries are one of the more common back injuries seen in tennis. </p></br>
        <b>Ankle sprains</b> </br>
    <p>Lateral ankle sprains are the most common ankle injury both in and out of sport and tennis is no exception. The fast paced changes of direction can lead to the ankle rolling over and damaging one of more of the lateral ligaments. This type of injury can be prevented by strengthening the calf, shin and peroneal muscles, ensuring good flexibility and performing proprioception exercises (using wobble boards etc).</p> </br>
      <b>Patella tendinopathy</b><br>
      <p>Also known as jumpers knee, patella tendinopathy is caused by repetitive strain on the tendon which connects the knee cap and quadriceps to the shin bone. Repetitive strain causes degenerative changes to the tendon, resulting in pain on jumping and running activities. Treatment should involve looking at the biomechanics of the player and correcting any problems such as a weakness in the VMO muscle or tightness in the quadriceps, as well as strengthening the quads eccentrically (with gravity so the muscle lengthens under tension). </p></br>
